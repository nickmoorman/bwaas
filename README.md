# Buzzwords As A Service

This is just a tiny webapp to return random buzzwords (that were stolen from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_buzzwords)).  Currently shows buzzwords from the following categories:
- ```/random```: completely random buzzword
- ```/business```: Business, sales and marketing
- ```/education```: Education
- ```/general```: General conversation
- ```/other```: Other/Uncategorized
- ```/politics```: Politics and current affairs
- ```/science```: Science and technology

Thanks to [Aaron Dobbe](https://github.com/Lavos5) and [Fernando Freire](https://github.com/dogonthehorizon) for random comments about getting buzzwords as a service that inspired me to throw this together.  =]
